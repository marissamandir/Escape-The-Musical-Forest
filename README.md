The idea for this project was born out of our team's shared love for and experience with music. We have each
done some studies in musical theory, and agreed that a particularly difficult element was identifying intervals. 
We wanted to create something that could help future music theory students, but was more engaging than endless 
practice exams. This is why we have chosen to implement our questions, alternating listening and singing exercises, in a game format. 
The forest elements provides a cohesive aesthetic and touch of whimsy in line with the 2024 Technica theme, "Wonder Awaits".

The file main.py contains all of our code. The ending_background, intro_background, loading_background,
question_bg, and notes png files make up our UI. We stored necessary audio files and their
corresponding scores in the intervalsounds and intervalimages folders. The technica 2024 file shows
the beginning stages of us learning pygame for this project.
